title: Of lenses and old viewfinders...
---
<p>I've been planning on doing this for a while now, but only just got time.</p>
<p>It was my dad and my aunts who told me that my grandfather was into photography. That's how my dad got interested in it. Watching him got me interested.</p>
<p>Back in those days, i.e. early 1950s, it was quite hard to get a simple point and shoot. Instead you had your Pentax, Zeiss-IKON, Kodak, AGFA, Rolleiflex among the prominent camera makers. My grandfather had both a Pentax and an IKON-Zeiss with an AFGA lens.</p>
<p>My dad tells me that my grandfather had his own dark room, complete equipped with appropriate chemicals (hypo solutions, silver nitrate solutions), a photo enlarger, and would meticulously prepare his photographs. Another time, I guess.Â My dad too initially developed his own photographs. Lucky him.</p>
<p>The first time I remember being aware of any camera was my dad's Minolta. Then sometime later, I remember him clicking with a Ricoh point and shoot. He handed it to me when I was, I think, 12 years old. And then, on and off, I've handled his Minolta, his later digital point and shoots from Sony, Panasonic, Olympus and Sony HandyCam. Now I have taken the Sony A-37 almost entirely for myself.</p>
<p>Recently back from Chennai, with a good bunch of photographs with me, I took to cleaning my Sony. You know, the casual brushing and all. While taking out the brushes my dad had, I came across two huge packs, stowed away carefully.</p>
<p>And then, the gold burst forth.</p>

<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03063.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-530" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03063.jpg" width="630" height="949" /></a> My dad's initials on them.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03068.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-529 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03068.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03070.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-528" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03070.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> I wish I could've put up some test shots.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03045.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-534" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03045.jpg" width="630" height="949" /></a> The lens hood, the yellow filter with its cleaning cloth.</p>
<p>The yellow filter was essential to Black/White photography, like to separate the clouds from the blue sky, essentially used to separate contrasting colors.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03048.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-533" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03048.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> It was through these hooks that the filter was held.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03041.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-536   " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03041.jpg" width="630" height="949" /></a> And this is an IKOPHOT photometer. I've used it a couple of times, a few years ago.</p>
<p>The needle you see in the image is still very sensitive.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03044.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-535" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03044.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> Still works. Amazingly well at that.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03118.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-515  " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03118.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> F/4 - 32. Tokina lens.</p>

<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03023.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-539" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03023.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> This is my dad's Pentax.</p>
<p>My grandfather also had one. One that he had bought after meticulous research and calculation. All that and then it got stolen on a train journey. That incident really hit him. After that he was never the same way about cameras.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03026.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-538 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03026.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03074.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-527 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03074.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> Ricoh XF 30. Point and shoot.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03090.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-523 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03090.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> My grandfather asked a friend to get a flash for him. This, sadly, stopped working a while back.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03080.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-526   " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03080.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> And the Minolta: 50 mm F/1.4. Alongside its telephoto lens: 70 - 210 mm.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03082.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-525" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03082.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> The 400si.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03088.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-524 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03088.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> 70-210 mm. AF</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03094.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-522 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03094.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> Our first digital camera. Sony Cybershot, 3.2 mp. Point and shoot.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03097.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-521" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03097.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> With a 3x optical zoom, when we first bought it it was quite expensive.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03101.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-520" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03101.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> The Olympus FE 20. 8 megapixels.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03102.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-519" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03102.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> Those dents along the lens you see are actually from the time my nephew threw it on the ground, jamming the lens at an awkward angle. We got it fixed though.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03126.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-512 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03126.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> The Panasonic Lumix DC Vario. 14 meagapixels. Touchscreen interface. And an amazing camera.</p>
<p>Boy has this camera been around ! It's gone to Auli, Nainital, Ranikhet, travelled abroad with my dad, to a couple concerts with me, been passed around my circle of friends... It takes good quality pictures with an awesome zoom. Very good value for money. Still my point and shoot travel companion. Never disappoints.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03125.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-513 " alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03125.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a></p>
<p>That's it then. I have assembled all of the above in one photo below, the Lumix being an exception. Quite a collection I've got their, huh ?</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03105.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-518" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03105.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> The entire collection with all the tools and equipment.</p>
<p>I have deliberately not included my A-37 in this post. I think I feel that it's still a part of the present; these guys, well they have had their time in the limelight.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dsc03108.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-517" alt="" src="/images/assets/dsc03108.jpg" width="630" height="418" /></a> Quite a trove, eh ?</p>
<p>My only regret is that I haven't seen my grandfather's Pentax. It was an F/1.2 or so my dad says. No hope there.</p>
<p>Oh, and also that I haven't shot with a Leica F/1 as of yet. There's still hope on that front, though. Slim, but still.</p>
