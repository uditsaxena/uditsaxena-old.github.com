title: Makings of a bibliophile ??
---
<p>It was April, and I was back home for the last time before my my end semester exams. My mom and brother were leaving for Lucknow to meet a few relatives so it was gonna be me and my dad alone in the house for about a week. I was hanging around the house when I took up a long forgotten idea of mine.</p>
<p>I started cataloging my collection of books; mine -that is both me and my dad's - collected over the last 3 decades or so. My dad too was supportive and with mom being absent to fuss over the mess, it was the perfect time.</p>
<p>It was with almost childlike glee that I stacked up my books on my bed, stacks as tall as I am( not that I'm tall) ! It was good holding books which I had not touched for over half a decade, and had spent a large chunk of my childhood getting lost in.</p>
<p>I was so jobless I actually took up a few - reading my favorite parts of them was so refreshing ! Some book s are too much fun to only read once. Sometimes I was surprised that I found a new meaning between the lines, other times I was left dumbfounded that my younger self ever read such material. But I guess that's how life is.</p>

<p>There, just right above the Harry Potter series was the space occupied by the Wheel of Time series. There on the top is another hole - probably dad's photography books.</p>
<p>A lot of this was done on time ( before mom came back ) with the help of my dad.</p>
