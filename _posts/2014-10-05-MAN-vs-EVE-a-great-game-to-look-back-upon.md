title: MAN vs EVE - a great game to look back upon.
---

<p>Massive, massive 3 points. Lot of positive stuff to take away from this match. </p>

<p>The base is forming - the "LVG philosophy" is almost tangible in the way we played the first 70 minutes, give or take 5. The last part of the last two matches have been scrappy, with the aggressiveness dropping significantly in the middle third - this might not be enough against better teams - City and Chelsea most notably. I've heard of the training regimen LVG has his players go through. I feel that stamina boost hasn't shown up in the latter minutes of the game.</p>

<p>Blind is blooming in his role. Though I don't get why Martinez dealt with him the way he did, giving him so much space and little challenge, if any - his job was too easy, at least for the first 55 minutes or so - he is perfect at the base of the diamond both going forward and falling back. His dynamics with Carrick (if and when) should be an interesting change from the dearth of depth in a lot of squad roles we're used to for the past 12 - 14 months.</p>

<p>Falcao's first ! Though debatable, looking at the replays I believe Di Maria meant that pass. Kudos to Falcao for his finish. He'd come agonizingly close to scoring before that chance and him having left the pitch goalless, today, would've been a little harsh. </p>

<p>Valencia, from the looks of this game, has been tempered as well. He was quietly doing his job, supporting, almost deferring his wide role to his full back and being the fulcrum of a few 3-man overlaps. Otherwise he was a dependable replacement for a missing part of the diamond. Good to see a little aggression from him as well.</p>

<p>The defence has made long strides in the right direction - not near as close to what we're used to - but nowhere near as bad as what we imagined with the experienced countenances of Smalling, Jones and Evans out of play. Frankly I don't know whether this is Rojo's natural position or that he's come in from a CDM position or a full back one (I'm unsure of where he played at Sporting)- but he's getting the hang of it. Though we have major problems with attacks coming in from the wings - and clearing them (remember that Rooney outburst at the Leicester game?) - going the way Everton were today - direct and through Blind, it was a top-half-of-the-table defensive performance in the worst of moments. </p>

<p>De Gea's performance was, for a lack of better words, out of this world. That last diving save after multiple rebounds was definitely worth two points. </p>

<p>The red card was one all day long. Technically, it was one. And come on, we've seen worse given. </p>

<p>Mata had a sub-par (ordinary ?) day. Van Persie was his ordinary self as well. 
They were both carried on by the impeccable performance of our - my - new, favourite player - Di Maria ! Great flicks, that goal and assist, the continuous rotation of play across wings makes him, apart from De Gea, our most important player. With Rooney not present, RVP and Mata off their form and Falcao still playing catch up, we depended too much on him in the final third. This would not go well against the likes of City and Chelsea.</p>

<p>Also, you can see how LVG has worked with him. Two, three matches ago, he was fast and pacey - too incongruous for the well oiled machine in LVG's vision. A player who would be much better with his teammates going forward, it seemed he was asked to slow it a bit. And Di Maria complied - a bit too much - if you look at the last game. He got that balance right today it seems - and will hopefully get closer to what we ask of him. And the others match up his much required pace.</p>

<p>I'm extremely worried about Shaw's injury - I mean, give us a break ! Our list of injured make up a team that can - looking at QPR's woes - easliy usurp their place in the Premier League. 
The international break should give us valuable time to recover.</p>

<p>All in all, a good game for the team's confidence. The first follow-up victory in the Premier League for LVG, against a strong opponent, following a shaky victory at West Ham last week. </p>

<p>And we made top four !</p>

<p>PS: What's up with Wenger and Mou ? Did you see that shove ?!? </p>
