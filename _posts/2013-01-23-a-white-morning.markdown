title: A white morning.
---
<p>He rolled over under his blankets, trying to keep all gaps blocked. Even under two layers, he could still feel the extreme cold outside. With one eye, he looked at the time. Six-thirty. He groaned, "Not today!", pulling the blanket over his head. After a few minutes trying to drfit back to sleep, he realised that today was not his day.He got out of bed reluctantly, making sure no part of his body was exposed for more than 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Just when he had almost forgotten about it, his unnatural habit of not being able to sleep for more than six hours had struck again. Just when he was alone, with everyone having gone back home for the winter break. <em>Why did I ever sign up for that project ?</em> he thought for the hundredth time. Another glance at his watch - thirtieth of December. <i>Damn, its cold!. </i>He reached for his socks, muffler, cap and gloves.Once covered properly, he opened his door to go to the bathroom, bracing himself for the cold outside.</p>
<p>He never felt the cold, moist air hit him. He was too busy gaping at the sight his brain couldn't fathom.</p>
<p>It was dawn outside. Something white - snow white - lay all around his hostel QT. It covered the tree at the center of the QT, its boughs weighing down with the white stuff.</p>
<p><em>It can't be! </em>his mind racing to conclusions. He stepped down into the QT, gingerly descending the steps, never stepping into the white stuff. He took off one of his gloves and bent down to feel it. It was cold and crispy, like ice and powdery. That confirmed it.</p>
<p>It had snowed in Pilani.</p>
<p>Today was going to be awesome.</p>
<p>*~*</p>
<p>"But it's not possible! Go back to sleep, you're dreaming.", a sleepy, annoyed voice said on the phone. "When you come back, I'll have pictures for you guys.", he said as he hung up, seeing another sleepy, frail arguement in the forming. Quickly leaving his Bhawan after making sure he was more than prepared for the snow, he started off for Sky. He had his camera with him.</p>
<p>Outside, he saw the snow was quite thin, and was in small, irregular deposits, nowhere near as thick as he had seen in his QT. It was quiet and he was alone; he had barely woken up 2 minutes ago. He saw the construction grounds had pockets of snow; some had settled on wet cement.<em> That'll have to be redone. </em></p>
<p>Sky was completely white. The green was gone, and even in the gray sky of dawn, there was a shine to the thin white layer in its place. Walking to the center of the field, his footprints left a clear path. Numerous cliches of snow angels came to his mind... as did a few Calvin and Hobbes instances. There wasn't enough snow around him for a snowman.</p>
<p>But he wanted wider expanse of snow around him. He decided to head for the RC grounds. Besides, he figured that the walk would do him good.</p>
