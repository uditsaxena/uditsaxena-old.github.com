title: ! 'Google Summer of Code 2014: Accepted !'
---
<p style="color:#222222;">Well, this summer just became super awesome !</p>
<p style="color:#222222;">I got accepted into the Google Summer of Code !</p>
<p style="color:#222222;">I'll be working with mlpack, a scalable Machine Learning Library. My project deals with implementing Multi-Class Adaboost for mlpack.</p>
<p style="color:#222222;">Later, I'll probably be shifting to another blog for GSoC related blogs.</p>
<p style="color:#222222;">Just wanted to put it out there. Really looking forward to this summer.</p>
