title: Cause Hollywood wouldn't be able to make any more movies..
---
<p>I know it's been a long time since I last posted but I hope to be more regular in the future.... I was coping with a few illnesses and then had to go back to college.</p>
<p>Recently me and my friend were watching this movie about this guy who uses this magic pill to enhance his mind(NOT a drug) and do all sorts of stuff pretty easily - but then his stash of pills runs out and then he screws up. His life falls apart and he basically loses everything he had- the dream job, the dream girl, the fancy car, the big apartment and most importantly social status. So cliche.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="No magic pill for us it seems.." src="/images/assets/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCgbdtbmu9wG1Izu5swgwppOzn5vSviNWnZvgjaVq_BKLw1nqolQ" alt="" width="207" height="155" /></p>
<p>After we were done we actually had a discussion about why the movie sucked (yeah we were THAT busy) - the sour point was that nothing in the Â movie would have happened the way it did if this ever happened to me or him(seriously, who hasn't done this?ever?). Why? Cause I would've been smarter. No reckless usage, always covering my tracks, knowing when to take and when to not. Calculating. Clever. Simple. Safe. No one would know. But this never happens (to <em>me</em>). Why? Cause it would be boring. Plain. Shallow. And the critics would never watch the movie after the trailer. And Hollywood would never make a single penny..</p>
<p>Though maybe I would watch it.</p>
