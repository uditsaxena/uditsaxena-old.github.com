title: A few lessons from this summer..
---
<p>Okay. I had 11 weeks off from college this summer. 8 of those involved an internship. Needless to say my summer was wrecked. And hectic.</p>
<p>With my internship taking up more than half of my days from Monday to Saturday ( yes a <em>6-day</em> week ! ) I never actually had time to catch up on all those carefully crafted plans and indulgent lists made before the internship, during the first week or so. Those lists and plans got flagged down or ended up as botched attempts as soon as I realized I travelled 2 hours to my place of work, each way.</p>
<p>During this unappreciated preview of my adult life, I found some treasures and realized quite a few epiphanies.</p>
<p><strong>1. Pink Floyd</strong> (<em>esp</em> <em>The Dark Side of the Moon) </em>still heals the day. The psychedelic experience, besides still being shockingly relevant -</p>
<p>"..And you run and you run</p>
<p>To catch up with the sun</p>
<p>But it's sinking</p>
<p>Racing around</p>
<p>To come up behind you again</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png/220px-Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png"><img class="alignleft" title="Dark Side of the Moon" src="/images/assets/220px-Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png" alt="" width="149" height="149" /></a>The sun is the same</p>
<p>In a relative way</p>
<p>But you're older</p>
<p>Shorter of breath</p>
<p>And one day closer to death.."</p>
<p><em>-Time, Pink Floyd ( Dark Side of the Moon ) </em></p>
<p>just puts you in a completely different mood, soothing your mind; warm, caressing, trance-like music that fills out the voids with its queer and unimaginatively complex harmonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Life without</strong> the web, the internet can be shockingly painful. For me, at least, not having an internet connection when I'm at my laptop or the iPad can be very, very dull and painfully restrained. The very immediateness of subjects, to be looked up without a  moments notice has gotten addictive. Because I recently <a title="A week since I became an Archer !!!" href="http://uditsaxena.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/a-week-since-i-became-an-archer/" target="_blank">shifted</a> over to Open Source and I'm constantly learning new things on the web through forums and courses, not having an internet connection was, to repeat again, restrained.</p>
<p>Believe me, I'm the kind of guy who <a title="Makings of a bibliophile ??" href="http://uditsaxena.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/makings-of-a-bibliophile/" target="_blank">collects and reads</a> a lot of books, a huge music collection to listen to, a more than acceptable social life, is a sports fanatic and its not like I was craving for the web while on the Metro back home. But if my laptop has some issue (usually some linux device driver problem in the beginning) the instant craving, shamefully, takes control.</p>
<p><strong>3. Spain still</strong> beats the heck out of any footballing nation. Not even Germany, the Netherlands or her Royal Blunder - England could do anything about that this Euro. Although I'm all for the competitiveness of the English side of football, the Spanish side pretty much ruled every base in football, except for that freak of nature - Chelsea - winning the Champions League. But more on that later.</p>
<p><strong>4. Roger Federer</strong> still rules the grass season. Though at the time of writing, he lost to Murray horribly in the Olympic finals. But the way he's holding and smiling at his silver, me thinks he might just be trolling Andy Murray and the entire British nation. Oh and yeah, Nadal is still the King of Clay.</p>
<p><strong>5. Delhi University</strong> cut-offs <em>remain</em> ridiculous, mocking and laughable and I just pity those looking for seats there this summer. The JEE is a mess too.</p>
<p><strong>6. You can</strong> probably earn a college degree online (at least a Computer Science one ), what with all the free courses shrooming up on the web. Don't believe me ? Check out this <a title="Brilliant material here." href="http://www.noexcuselist.com" target="_blank">link</a> and then talk.</p>
<p><a href="https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRxr1RkkTdtMQmBgUrmLgs2IxOSO7G9NpNupdOu2Bj8-i7Au6Tivw"><img class="alignright" title="Drive" src="/images/assets/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRxr1RkkTdtMQmBgUrmLgs2IxOSO7G9NpNupdOu2Bj8-i7Au6Tivw" alt="" width="199" height="254" /></a><strong>7. To drive</strong> is to attain nirvana. Having got a little more than 600-odd km on the road under 4 months, I believe I was destined to drive (stick that is). My dad being my role model here though, I have come to hate most of the traffic in Delhi with their retarded sense of traffic rules and self-righteousness.</p>
<p>Nonetheless be it a hatch-back or an SUV, I can probably drive the wheels off it, given enough time and asphalt. And costly, precious Petrol.</p>
<p><strong>8. John Mayer's</strong> "Born and Raised" is the perfect album to drive to. (You know, apart from Sabbath, Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, Maiden and Metallica, Alter Bridge, Audioslave, Floyd, Hendrix, Foo Fighters and probably Coldplay) With its soft sounds humming you to peace, not even the most retarded of drivers can shake your composure. His previous works were good enough with him hitting a low point with Battle Studies but I believe he's really come back with this one.</p>
<p><strong>9. You can</strong> probably spend an entire day browsing through <a title="browse by.." href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>, and still not get to the bottom of all the cool links and knowledge of the users and commenters. It boasts of a user base of people genuinely passionate about topics they post, and almost all links, questions, projects and topics to be found here, from economics through math, science, tech, startups, to astronomy, are assured to be deep and insightful.</p>
<p>Regular visits, probably once or twice a day can be enlightening on many different levels.</p>
<p><strong>10. I think</strong> I probably need to write and post more often. Hope to do that during this half of the year.</p>
<p>How was your summer ?</p>
