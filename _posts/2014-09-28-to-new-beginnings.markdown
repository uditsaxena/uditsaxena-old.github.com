<p>Hi there ! </p>
<p>I've just shifted from my earlier blog <a href="http://uditsaxena.wordpress.com">here</a>. Though blogging on wordpress is quite easy and comfortable, I was always intrigued by blogs I came across hosted as *.github.io pages. I wanted to have one of my own.</p>
<p>Hence this blog. I've set it up using Jekyll and the template for the blog has been borrowed from <a href="http://www.ksornberger.com">Kevin Sornberger's</a> blog site after very few modifications.</p>
<p> The true problem was importing all my posts from my previous wordpress blog - but that's for another day, maybe.</p>
<p>That's it for now. I'm sure I'll have lots to write once I get going. I'm still getting used to writing in markdown - maybe I'll start using one of those handy markdown editors everyone keeps talking about. </p>
