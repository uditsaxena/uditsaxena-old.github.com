title: A new lens !
---
<p>When I tell you how far andÂ long this lens had to travel to sit snugly on my A-37, you'll be left scratching your head.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I won't.</p>
<p>I just bought a 50mm f/1.4 lens. And the experience, however short, has been breathtaking.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a few pictures.</p>
<p>PS: A good friend of mine told me that I'm in my "noise is so cool" phase. I'm advised that it will pass soon. Hopefully (?)</p>

<p>Because I'm spending too much time apart from my camera, I have only so many to preview. More to come later on.</p>
