title: I am an amateur Vintner. This is my wine.
---
<p>This isn't your usual vintner's (if you do call a vintner usual!)post - how s/he posts the recipe used and goes about each step telling the good and bad of the what, how and when of making wine at home.</p>
<p>I have been making wine at home for a year now. This is the latest batch.</p>
<p><a href="http://uditsaxena.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dsc01565.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-371 " alt="Beautiful color." src="/images/assets/dsc01565.jpg" width="640" height="424" /></a> White wine. Beautiful color.</p>
<p>My dad started making wine about two decades ago. He helped me last time. Unfortunately last time, I was too involved in learning the process to actually record it with a few pictures. This time I did get a few.</p>
<p>Its quite potent and mildly sweet. I actually wanted to gauge its strength but for lack of time, could not.</p>
<p>I didn't want to post the recipe here. I wanted people to focus more on the outcome, the <em>romantic</em> beauty of <a title="Wine Making" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winemaking" target="_blank">Vinification</a>. A recipe turns out to be <em>classically</em> ugly, with its lecturing tone and follow-me-blindlyÂ procedural.</p>
<p>But if people do want it, I'll update this post with a link.</p>
<p>I have shot these with my <a title="A-37" href="http://www.sony.co.in/product/slt-a37" target="_blank">Sony A-37</a>.</p>
<p>PS: the classic and romantic split is derived from my current read, <a title="ZAMM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance" target="_blank">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.</a> Cheers !</p>
