title: The Winter after. And before. (And to the end of the year.)
---

<p>Well, the mandatory recharge period, after coming back home from college, of about a week - ten days is over and I feel I should get down to business. </p>
<p>Posts I hope, now, shall come thick and fast. Even though the quality might (will ?) suffer, I hope to raise the sickeningly low bar for the number of posts over a single period.</p>
<p>This is, as I see it, the last, long break I'll have to myself in a while. And I mean in a <i>while</i></p>
<p>So, I'm trying to make it as fun, as productive as I can. Travelling, reading, just sleeping, hanging around with good people... all the while trying to get some work on my side projects done. </p>
<p>It has been a while. There have been a lot of changes. Hostel life has ended. College life - well, almost. I've changed my blogging platform from a wordpress blog to one being run on a jekyll setup.</p>

<p> I'm moving out at the beginning of Jan. An internship at Intel beckons. Full-time work at Sprinklr after that. Graduate studies sometime later, maybe ?</p>
<p>This past year I successfully participated in the tenth edition of the Google Summer of Code, 2014, interning and working at MLPACK. MLPACK is now migrating from 'trac' to <a href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack">github.</a> Check us out !</p>
<p>I have recently jailbroken my iPhone 4 (yeah, I know). I also gave my GRE successfully this year. And my last semester on campus saw me get hired at <a href="http://www.sprinklr.com">Sprinklr</a> as well work on Multivariate Time Series Analysis on Gesture Recognition with my Thesis advisor.</p>

<p>I loved and hated a Watermann. Became <i>the</i> go-to coffee guy in my circles.</p>
<p> Saw Manchester United stumble, fall, get up and start trudging towards the top of the table again. Not without tantrums along the way. </p>
<p>The Legend of Korra ended. A most satisfying experience, that one. The Newsroom did too, after a spectacular last season. The Hobbit saga also saw the curtain fall, after an amazing 17 years in run, with Peter Jackson at the helm. (though I would call LotR and the Hobbit different epics and hence different time periods altogether, but I'll let it pass for now)</p>
<p>I finished my undergraduate studies (well, almost !) at BITS Pilani.</p>
<p>Made new friends. Rekindled old friendships. Strengthed existing ones.</p>

<p><i>All over the place with this one, eh ?</i></p>
