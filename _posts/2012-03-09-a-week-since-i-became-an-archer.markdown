title: A week since I became an Archer !!!
---
<p>Last week I shifted, after a lot of contemplation (and hardwork), over to Arch Linux.</p>
<p>Given it wasn't that easy - once my Ubuntu Grub disappeared, I had to reinstall my Arch distro around 8 times to figure out where I was going wrong - and yes, at one moment of time I actually had 4 different OSes booted on separate partitions on my laptop !! In the end I finally had to settle with Archbang Linux, based on the Arch kernel but with a different Window Manager.</p>

<p>And I tell you - the last week has been very tough but ( now that I come to think of it ) also very rewarding. Trying to get myself acquainted with my terminal - Terminator, different openbox themes, mpd, daemon files, the Arch wiki and forums and conky configs etc has been very exciting and I'm always learning.</p>
<p>So my desktop finally looks like :</p>

<p>This has come from a weeks worth of fiddling around.</p>
<p>For those of you who have no clue whats going on around here -</p>
<p>The arch philosophy 2.0 :</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Simple</span></strong><br />
without unnecessary additions, modifications, or complications<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Elegant</strong></span><br />
combining simplicity, power, effectiveness, a quality of neatness and an ingenious grace of design<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Versatile</strong></span><br />
capable of doing many things competently; having varied uses or many functions</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Expedient</strong></span><br />
easy, or quick; convenient</p>
<p>At the end of all of this you get a system which is yours and only yours. It has evolved as you have, reflects your personality, is as efficient as you have made it to be.</p>
<p>Never thought so much about an OS, have you?</p>
<p>But after all of this, Arch is not, I repeat NOT for everyone. It is for users who have spent considerable time with the CLI, know their way around a Linux system, have a hacker tendency - you learn by tweaking and fiddling around the system, and who are capable of dealing with errors and crashes on their own.</p>
<p>Or those who are capable of keeping up Arch'ssteeplearning curve.</p>
<p>With respect to the last point, the Arch user community is the "RTFM" type ( read the f****** manual ). Yes they will help you out, but they expect you to have researched a lot and read the first 5 pages of google search results. Thats how the Arch philosophy works - you (ALWAYS) learn by doing. No matter where the error is, you will always figure it out.</p>
<p>For more info head on over to <a title="Arch's website" href="http://www.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">http://www.archlinux.org/</a>.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks, I'll probably posting a few more posts on my progress.</p>
