		 <section id="center"><p>Hi ! I'm <a href="#"><strong>Udit Saxena</strong></a>.</p>
		 	<p>I am a Master's student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst studying Computer Science.</p>
		 	<p>My interests lie in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science and I am particularly excited to work on applications at the intersection of the two.</p>
		 	<p>I have completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and my Master's in Mathematics from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.</p>
		 	<p>I have worked as a Product Engineer with the Core team at <a href="http://www.sprinklr.com">Sprinklr</a>, a social media analytics startup. </p>
		 	<p>At Sprinklr, I was responsible for REST-based API integrations and extensions, third-party product integrations and implementing Single Sign On with Sprinklr as an Identity Provider.</p>
		 	<p>In the summer of 2014, I was a Google Summer of Code intern, working with MLPACK, a C++ based open source machine learning library. At MLPACK, I worked on including the Adaboost algrithms for the library, by using Decision Trees and a Perceptron (a single layer neural network) as weak learners.</p>
		 	<p>I like meeting new people ! Get in <a href="mailto:usaxena@cs.umass.edu?subject=Hi!"><strong>touch</strong></a> !
