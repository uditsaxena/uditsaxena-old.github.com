    <p>This might end up being too extreme, but I've decided to stop listening to any track in my Music collection.</p>


<p>It's been a while since I've really listened to something new, something I really really took to. The first time that happened was to Linkin Park, back in early 2000s, then Metallica, then Maiden and Tool; Pink Floyd and Simon and Garfunkel followed soon after, and later some Blues; now, after three years of peer pressure, EDM.</p>


<p>I've picked up some alternative and punk rock; not to forget some absolutely amazing Post-Rock too ! But for the last two years or so, I've not really expanded existing or explored new musical horizons, apart from Avicii or Walldahl or Vicetone in the last few months.</p>


<p>Which is horrible. And apathetic. Or horribly apathetic. Bleargh !</p>


<p>It is the equivalent of sticking to the same gym routine for a year, reading the same couple of books over and over again, or re-mapping keys to different shortcuts while keeping your dotfiles functionally the same.</p>


<p>Or basically typing</p>


<blockquote><p>sudo pacman -Syu</p></blockquote>


<p>everyday for the last year.</p>


<p>So I've decided to stop listening to any track in my Music collection.</p>


<p>Instead, I'll make a point to continually explore new artists. Each day, or each song will be one I haven't heard of.</p>


<p>Quite extreme huh ?</p>


<p>I've given myself time to research artists and genres. It'll be a fortnightly cycle. I'll give myself a break after two weeks for a week then start again. I'll keep you posted.</p>


<p>I start New Year's Day. You know, just for that psychological clean slate.</p>
