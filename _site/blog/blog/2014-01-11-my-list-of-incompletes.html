<p>I have been trying to do this for a while, but finally, I think, making a comprehensive and loud commitment out of this would help me read all the books I've bought (sometimes on an impulse) and not read.</p>


<p>Yep. I'm pretty sure we all have that list.</p>


<p>I've been trying to get my head wrapped around TZ Lavine, but getting a complete picture is too hard until you have it a coursebook (probably an intro to psych course). The same thing happened with "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance". I took too long with that too.</p>


<p>"Nausea" was an impulse buy on a recommendation by an aunt, but Existentialism is too complicated right now, especially being introduced to it in Sartre's own words. "Confessions" by Tolstoy is my father's. And "Blue Citadel" and "Life is Elsewhere" were birthday gifts I haven't got around to yet.</p>


<p>"Lord of the Flies" just slipped my view otherwise it would have been over quite a while back and again, I had trouble getting used to Camus' narrative. Currently, I'm going through Berger, a recent addition (along with Milan Kundera's "The Unbearable Lightness of Being"), and Walden, treating each as a series of essays...hopefully I'll get the first six finished this semester.</p>


<p>I don't think I'll ever get through "Anathem". OrÂ "Shadows of the Mind" by Roger Penrose for that matter, which should be a thesis on advanced theoretical computational philosophy. No, seriously.</p>
