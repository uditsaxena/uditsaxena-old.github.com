    <p>Most people who know me well, would tell you I am an audiophile. Music has, in the last decade, majorly defined my life. From my first favorite song from Meteora - Somewhere I Belong, I have come a long way.</p>


<p>Do you believe your music defines you, your personality ? I do. And as I realized after an interesting conversation with a good friend</p>


<p>Overtime, you realize that your inner ear gets tuned to a certain kind of music, and the frequency of hearing that sort (your sort) of music changes your entire outlook towards the music experience. You look out for certain types of genres - in my case mostly metal and heavy metal, hard, punk, alternative, slow rock, and OST - instrumentals by Hans Zimmer, Trent Reznor, Howard Shore, Alexandre Desplat, Alan Silvestri, Nicholas Hooper.</p>


<p>As I came to college, this was the kind of music I listened to and still do. Here I discovered heavyweights and classics like The Who, Rush, Led Zeppelin, Ozzy, Iron Maiden, Pink Floyd, Soundgarden, Motley Crue, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Alice Cooper. This was because I looked for them and found them out.</p>


<p>At the same time, and much to my distaste, I got to knowÂ Daft Punks's trance like electronics, pop artists that I listened to more than once, and party anthems usually known for their high bass fast beats and some rap-artists. That was mostly due to my close friend circle. And I ignored such music.</p>


<p>Just a few days back I realized that my earlier resistance to that sort of music was worn down and I had actually taken to quite a few tracks (some from the recent "Project X" movie). After a conversation with a good friend, I realized why I had changed so.</p>


<p>Why</p>
